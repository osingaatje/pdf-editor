## Adding missing fonts
**NOTE**: BEFORE YOU EDIT THE PDFs, MAKE SURE TO ADD THE CORRECT FONTS WITH A TOOL SUCH AS [GhostScript](https://ghostscript.com/)!
- on Windows, this is the executable `gswin64c` located in `Program Files\gs\gs10.05.0\bin` 
- on Linux, this is the `gs`.

see GhostScript - Fonts ([Here](https://ghostscript.com/docs/9.54.0/Fonts.htm) or [here](https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fonts.html)) for more info.
